			<p>Hey Julia,</p>
			<p>Michelle did a lovely job making me sound like a real prize. "Someone at work said that he has a cute butt.   That made me want to throw up." I heard that she actually did end up vomiting all over the president of AFS after he said that. Can you imagine? I guess it's of no surprise that she's leaving &#8212; if I can be candid with you, I think that after the "puke" show, they gave her the boot. But that's just me and I'm very into conspiracy theories.</p>
 			<p>Okay so I'm really not at all.</p> 
 			<p>So yeah, just to fill in some of the blanks: I am from Minnesota. I am working at a law firm downtown as a paralegal. I am thinking about grad/law school. I do have a friend named Cheddar Bob. I live in Battery Park City with a 52 year old Italian woman named Vinnie &#8212; whom I love and who actually got me in the door here at my new job. I have one younger brother, 24.  BJ.  We're super tight. Also tight with my parents &#8212; who live in Minnesota as well &#8212; I'm the only one in my family to have ever gotten outside of the Minnesota/Wisconsin/South Dakota stronghold.... Well, not really.  You ever been?  Ah...Minnesota.  Anyhow, yeah, I was in the Peace Corps in West Africa (Niger) &#8212; that usually seems interesting to people. My work was pretty non-substantial over there, but I totally had a great time.  Um...the Cheddar Bob line, yeah, that was a line from that movie 8-Mile. Thought I'd throw it in there to be zany.  Since, afterall, Michelle did say you were zany.</p>
 			<p>But anyways, if you're down, let's meet up. If nothing else, I'm thinking that we won't bore one another.
You sound pretty fantastic!!  No pressure. (kidding).</p>
			<p>See ya,<br/>Andy</p>

			<p>Hello Andy,</p>
 			<p>Thanks for your fun email. I will write back later because I'm currently crazed due to a problem with Western Union in Cusco.</p>
 			<p>I'd love to meet up. However, I'll be leaving for Peru for 10 ish days on Saturday.</p>
 			<p>Anyway, hope all is well for you!</p>
 			<p>I think we will have a fun time together.<br />
			Even if it is awkward ...or weird...</p>
 			<p>not that it would be...of course.</p>
 			<p>Cheers!<br />Julia</p>

    		<p>ANDY!<br />
			I would love to meet up tomorrow. However, I already had plans.</p>
			<p>I'm going to this place called Essex on the Lower East Side. I'm
meeting some old coworkers of mine. You're welcomed to join us.
Although you may think it is weird meeting three random girls for the
first time.</p>
			<p>However, if you're up for it - Everyone is very nice.</p>
			<p>I can give you more details later.</p>
			<p>Hope all is well for you!<br />Julia</p>

			<p>Que Paso?<br />So. I spoke with friend of mine (Peace Corps buddy) and we'd like to stop by if that's o-tay with you all. Like<br />9:30 or so. His twin is in Peace Corps in South America.  I feel like it may be in Peru. Maybe not. I can't remember.<br />
Lemme know!<br />

			<p>Well, Michelle said your were "Super Hot" and "Super Cute." So it should be easy right?!</p>
 			<p>But, in all actuality, no, I have no idea what you look like.<br />
			Should I bring a sign? Or wear my fluorescent pink muscle shirt? Not sure if I'll need that, I'm pretty easy to spot. Not many guys weigh in at 350 lbs. at 5' 2".<br />
Psych. How about I call you when we're close and you come outside and I'll just keep saying "Julia" to who I hope is actually Julia?</p>
 			<p>Okay, fine, what do you look like?</p>
 			<p>Bye,<br />
			Andy<br />
			Oh yeah, my number is 651 XXX XXXX</p>
