            <h4>Itinerary</h4>
        	<p>Friday, for our guests, we will have a welcome dinner at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oistins">Oistins</a>, a fish market where locals and tourists gather to eat, drink, and hang out...</p><p>Saturday is the wedding. The house is in the middle of the island. We will provide transportation from your hotel to and from the wedding for our guests.</p>
<p>The bride and groom will be arriving mid-week before the wedding and will be on island through October 8th. Other than Friday and Saturday night, we'll keep the group posted about where we’ll be hanging out  so you can come meet up if you like.</p><p>Further details to come and will be posted here.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div id="content_2" class="content">
        	<h4>Accommodations:</h4>
			<p>The bride and groom will likely be staying on the South Coast of the island at Southern Palms (Bougainvillea has recently informed us that they are doing renovations). We may move to another hotel the night of the wedding.</p>
			<p class="detailsPagesImages"><img src="http://juliaandandy.com/images/us.png" alt="" /><br /><span class="caption">In Northern Barbados, May 2012</span></p>
			<p>It’s a relatively small island geographically, but the roads are definitely not on a grid system (as we are used to here in the US) and getting around from one point in the island to another can take a bit of time (from the south of the island to the top of the island by car takes about an hour). Given this, we recommend that you stay in or close to the parish (like a county) of Christ Church. You can see it on a <a href="http://www.accessbarbados.com/barbados_parishes.php">map here</a> (for your reference, Fisher Pond is in St. John).</p>

<p><strong>Here are a few recommendations in the area:</strong>

  </li> 
  <li><a href="http://www.moonrakerbarbados.com/">Moonraker</a> - quality-wise somewhere between Cleverdale and Little Arches (see below)... close to the action, but in a quiet little area. Surfer vibe with a cool bar and grill on site. Rooms are actually like new apartments and start at about $65/night with our discount. <em>Our party will get 20% off the listed prices on the website.</em> </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.thecrane.com/">The Crane</a> - A step up from Bougainvillea, but away from the action... equal parts Disney World  and tropical paradise (beautiful, stunning views, lots of high-end restaurants and many swimming pools). All rooms come with mahogany furniture, an amazing kitchen, laundry and start at around $225/night. About a 20 min drive from the Moonraker. Best prices can be found by searching online.</li>
  <li><a href="http://barbados-rentals.com/web/english/Barbados_cheap_beach-house.htm">Cleverdale Guest House</a> - bargain basement on a great beach in a prime location.

  <li><a href="http://www.littlearches.com/">Little Arches</a> - beautiful beautiful beautiful... but they don’t allow kids to stay at the hotel. Rooms range from about $220+/night. Great beach and incredible rooftop restaurant to boot.</li>

  <h4>Getting There:</h4>
  <p>Fly to Bridgetown International (BGI). Carriers include: Jet Blue, American Airlines, Britsh Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Air Canada, WestJet, US Airways, American Eagle, Caribbean Airways, LIAT and a number of charter airlines. <span class="red">NOTE:</span> American Airlines will give our guests a 5% discount off the lowest applicable published air fare using the Promotion Code: <strong>8292BX</strong>.The discount will be valid from Sep 22- Oct 6, 2012 for travel to Barbados (BGI).</p>   
  <h4>Getting Around:</h4>
  <p>Public transport is <strong>solid</strong> and taxis abound (in the busy areas), but consider renting a car if you want to have the freedom to explore the island (Note: We rented a car for 3 days and it cost about $200US. Buses/Vans are $1 US/$2 Bajan). Roads are generally narrow - at times ridiculously so - and you'll have to get used to driving on the other side of the road, but for us, it was worth it. If you do rent a car<span class="red">*</span>, pay the extra few bucks for GPS.</p>
  <p>Note: We will provide transportation to/from the wedding location from/to your hotels.</p>

  <h4>Things to do in Barbados:</h4>
  <p>For some preliminary information on Barbados, we recommend <a href="http://www.accessbarbados.com/barbados_resort.php">check this out.</a> In addition, please feel free to contact either of us - we were just there and should be able to field any questions.</p>
  <h4>Weather:</h4>
  <p>There isn’t a ton of variation from one month to the next in Barbados. There will be rain, sun, and it will be hot and humid. About 85 during the day and 78 in the evening. Barbados is outside of the hurricane belt so we should be okay - knock on wood!</p>
  <h4>Money</h4>
  <p>Currency is currently $1US = $2Bajan. They take US Dollars - even in the supermarkets. But you will get Bajan money back. Prices for food and groceries are equal to NYC prices. US Products like tampons and bugspray will cost you a bit more - so bring them with you.</p>

  <h4>Stuff to do while there:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Nightlife</em> - Most of the literature on the island will tell you about how incredible and hopping St. Lawrence Gap ("the Gap") is... we went and were a little underwhelmed. But after full days in the sun we were usually asleep by 10:30.</li>
    <li><em>Beaches</em> - The beautiful beaches are all public in Barbados and all different on the different ends of the island. We hung out at Sandy Beach (south) in Worthing (right in front of our guest house). It was fantastic and at low tide you could walk out to the reef. Had we had snorkel gear, it probably would have been great. There are also lots of water sports such as surfing and wind surfing. I don’t think you can go wrong - just don’t swim on the east coast (the Atlantic side)... or if you do, be careful... we hear it is dangerous. You can watch world-class surfers at <a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/travel/29barbados.html?pagewanted=all">Soup Bowl</a> on the East Side.  </li>
    <li><em>Non-beach nature</em> - in the following order: <a href="http://www.uncommoncaribbean.com/2011/02/17/on-site-barbados-exploring-the-craggy-north-shore/">North Shore Cliffs</a> (rugged and amazing), <a href="http://www.huntesgardensbarbados.com/">Hunte’s Garden</a> (the life’s work of the completely eccentric expat, Anthony... try his rum punch!), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathsheba,_Saint_Joseph,_Barbados">Bathsheba</a> (hilly, quaint, and beautiful... drive along the beach and enjoy), and <a href="http://www.graemehall.com/index.php">Graeme Hall</a> (partially closed, but get a cappuccino and/or rum punch and feed the huge tilapia).</li>
    <li><em>Oistins</em> - see you there on Friday evening... deliciously fresh fish plates for $15US and cheap beers.</li>
    <li><em>Restaurants</em> - <a href="http://www.tidesbarbados.com/">Tides</a> (Shmancy... located on the West Coast...beautiful spot and runner up for our wedding), <a href="http://www.littlearches.com/dining-overview.html ">Cafe Luna</a> at Little Arches (runner up for our wedding... amaze), <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g147266-d1630479-Reviews-Surfer_s_Bay-Christ_Church_Barbados.html">Surfer's Bay Bar and Grill</a> (cool), <a href="http://www.champersbarbados.com/">Champers</a> (recommended by those "in the know"- on our list of places to try), <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g666622-d1770852-Reviews-Shakers_Bar_Grill-Rockley_Christ_Church_Barbados.html">Shakers</a> (recommended by those "in the know" - on our list of places to try), <a href="http://www.thelonestar.com/aboutus/">Lone Star</a> (recommended by those “in the know” - on our list), <a href="http://www.chefette.com/">Chefette</a> (Barbados’ McDonalds... try the roti!).</li>
